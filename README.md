# anki-tools

To use, clone the repository somewhere. Then, if you are on Linux, run linker.sh to create symlinks from the Anki media folder to each of the files in this repository. If you are on a different operating system, you'll have to create the links yourself.

Then you will be able to import them from Anki cards like so:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="_duncrob99-anki-tools-prettify.css" />
<script src="_duncrob99-anki-tools-storage.js"></script>
```
